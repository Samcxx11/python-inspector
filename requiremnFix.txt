 Recreate requirements.txt Manually
Try creating a new requirements.txt file manually with the following:

cp requirements.txt requirements_backup.txt  # Create a backup
nano requirements.txt  # Open in an editor






Try Installing Packages Before Running python-inspector
Before running the python-inspector command, try installing the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt


 Use Python 3.11 Compatible Packages
Your requirements.txt file contains some old packages (e.g., arrow==0.10.0, bottle==0.12.12), which might not be fully compatible with Python 3.11. Try updating the package versions:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install --upgrade boto3 arrow bottle
Then regenerate requirements.txt using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip freeze > requirements.txt
5. Run python-inspector with Debugging
Try running python-inspector with --verbose to get more details:

bash
Copy
Edit
python-inspector --python-version 311 --operating-system macos --json-pdt o.json --analyze-setup-py-insecurely --requirement /Users/gbuwa/IdeaProjects/terrestrial-pipeline/python/requirements.txt --verbose
This might give more insights into the specific package causing the issue.

6. Check for a Broken Cache
Try clearing any cached dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip cache purge
Then reinstall:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
